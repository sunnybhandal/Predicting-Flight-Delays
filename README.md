# Predicting-Flight-Delays

## Description
This project was used to predict flight delays using supervised learning methods and NoSQL databases.

### Final Model
Includes the process of the analysis. Starting with data exploration, we found valuable insights into the data that we later developed into features for testing. Visuals were creating using Tableau and Matplotlib.

### Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost

### Programs and Packages
Tableau, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), PostgreSQL

### Data Description
Details the features found in the three tables that are used for analysis.
